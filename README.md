# 👋 Hi, I'm Adriano Minniti

I'm a detective transitioning into the world of cybersecurity and digital forensics. With a background in law enforcement and investigations, I'm now building hands-on technical skills through Raspberry Pi-based projects, custom networking builds, and forensic toolkits.

# 👋 Hi, I'm MtnMinniti

I'm a detective transitioning into the world of cybersecurity and digital forensics. With a background in law enforcement and investigations, I'm now building hands-on technical skills through Raspberry Pi-based projects, custom networking builds, and forensic toolkits. I'm also learning how to best leverage and implement AI solutions into current workflows.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

- 🔎 **[Forensic Pi Toolkit](https://github.com/MtnMinniti/forensicpi)** – A Raspberry Pi Zero W live response tool that emulates a keyboard to extract volatile data.
- 🧠 **[Home Lab](https://github.com/MtnMinniti/MiniMinnitiRack)** – VLAN-segmented home lab with MS-01, Ubiquiti, and Raspberry Pi's for monitoring, DNS filtering (Pi-hole), and remote access with Tailscale.
- 🧪 **Sandboxed Analysis** – Recovered and repurposed hardware for malware analysis, RAM dump parsing, and tool experimentation.
